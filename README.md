## an IoT project

![Yellow-Umbrella](public/assets/yellow-umbrella.png)

### Background

This repository contains all work done for the IT assessment. Much of the project is from the work done in class, following Mr Z as he worked on the screen. I hope to improve the app, so that it also calculates fire risk, and keeps track of daily, weekly, and all-time high and low temperatures.

### Development Roadmap

- [x] Setup repos - GitHub
- [x] setup ESP32 - Arduino IDE
- [x] Install dependencies - aREST.h and DHT.h
- [ ] Test ESP32 - get json data via wifi
- [ ] Initialize Node.js environment
- [ ] setup server.js with express
- [ ] set index route and views
- [ ] link ESP32 to Node app with fetch
